# Real-time-temperature-Model
This model is a Decision Tree Classifier designed to predict overheating based on temperature data. It uses temperature values and their differences to classify whether overheating occurs (>28Â°C). The model is trained on a small dataset, evaluated for accuracy, and tested on new temperature values.
